## ✨ Project Overview

**Book Store** is a university web project designed to create a modern, user-friendly, and highly efficient online bookstore. We wanted to practice our front-end skills by recreating something familiar but enough to learn from.



This project was developed as a requirement for the **Web Development** course within the **Computer Systems Engineering** curriculum.
